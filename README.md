<h3>Review</h3>
<p>Way to go! Here are some of the major concepts for conditionals:</p>
<ul>
<li>An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.</li>
<li>if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.</li>
  <li>We can add more conditions using else if statements.</li>
  <li>Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.</li>
    <li>The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.</li>
    <li>The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.</li>
    <li>The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.</li>
    <li>The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.</li>
<li>A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.</li>
  </ul>
